# wordle-data

This repo contains several sets of wordle data in json and plain text formats. 

I have 2 projects that rely on these datasets. I initially was just scraping a webpage for this information, but the site owner got wise and kicked me off.

`answers.json`/`.txt` and `dated_answers.txt` contain all previous correct answers.

The dates in `dated_answers.txt` at in mm-dd-yy format.

`word_frequency.json`/`.txt` contain every legal word sorted by its corpus frequency (and secondarily by alphabetical order)
